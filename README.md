# Fishing-shop
Fishing shop "Nasluka" is a very simple version of a web shop, which still does not support all the necessary functionality. Generally speaking, this is a university course work aimed at acquainting students, including myself, with the basics of the languages HTML and CSS, and partly Javascript. This project is build thanks to Visual Studio Code. 
This is the first page and its menu bar.

Clicking once on the menu on the left, the site sends us to the specific paragraph of the page that corresponds to the item we are looking for.

After pressing the button "Преглед" each item can be viewed separately with its detailed description and photos.

Each item has a form for quick order that requires first name, surname, family name, city and delivery address. If all fields are filled in, after pressing the button "Поръчай" a green message appears: "'first name' 'family name', Благодарим Ви за поръчката!". Otherwise, if the fields are not filled - a red message appears: "Не сте въвели всички полета! Опитайте отново". If the order is successful the contents of the fields are deleted.

Each item has also a comment form that requires first name, last name and the comment. If all fields are filled in and the button "Продължи" is pressed, the comment is displayed under the form in a grey box. Otherwise, a red message appears: "Не сте въвели всички полета! Опитайте отново, моля." If the comment is submitted the contents of the fields are deleted and ready for the next comment.
